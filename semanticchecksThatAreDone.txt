POINTER ARRAYS ARE NOT DONE HOW TO DO THEM WHAT IS THE VM CODE EXPECTED
int$ a[1] = {2, 3, 4, 8}; ##WHAT TO DO WITH THESE KIND OF STUFF
##FOR NOW I AM JUST MENTIONNIG IN THE VM CODE THAT IT IS POINTER ARRAY BUT WE DONT KNOW HOW BIG
CANNOT DECLARE MULTIPLE ARRAYS IN A SINGLE line
NEED TO WRITE A EFFICIENT AND CLEAR WAY OF CONSTANT DECLARATION


1. break and continue cannot be written outside the loops
2. doens't allow to declare already declared varialbes, arrays
3. cannot assign to undeclareed variables, arrays
4. int &b = &c; doesnt work;
5. delete will only work on pointers
6. arithmetic operatiosn will work on only int and floats
7. logical operations will work on all datatypes //not a semantic check just for reminder
8. cannot assign different datatype // a = b or a+=b doesn't work if a and b are different datatypes // this is true even if a is array
///// but remember this is only for assignment cases... for decalratin cases, no semantic check is done yet.. will have to write
///// a = b doens't work if a is int and b is char... but int a = b will work because i didn't write semantic check for declarationStmt.. will write later.
9. as of now only allowing integers in the array access /// a[9] = 3 works.. a['f'] =3 doesnt work because we don't allow 'f' in [] of array
10. in switch stmt, the case expression and switch expression datatypes must match.. // you cannot compare a char in swithc to a integer case
11. canot return for void, cannot return wrong datatype for a funciton(Ex:: cannot return int for char function)
12. functioncall is also working for factor 
13. NOTE: funcitoncall did not implement for class or struct.. will have to look at it.
14. Declarations are done.. datatype checks during declarations is also complete..
15. once a variable is constant declared.. you cannot assign or change its value. ### REmemeber this is true for cases a = something or a+=somehting or on arrays also;
### I don't know how much it will work for assigning in functions.. mostly it should work there also because anyassignment must deal with '='
### so 'the constant variables cannot be changed once declared' is working in my opinion

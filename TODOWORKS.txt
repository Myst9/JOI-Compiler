pointers in stack how to represent them?
error checks from objectDeclarationStmt are removed..add them once clas DEF tree working is done.
struct and object def are remained
trycatchblock tree are remained.
once case check is done in switch statements, remove it from stack use pop(), becuase push operation push '+' then again push'-' for case2 which will compare '-' with '+' instead of operation with '-'
so you have to pop '+' first and then push '-'
